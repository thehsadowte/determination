          Even in classical mechanics, the energy of any atom depends on the
          gravitational interaction. Therefore, the frequency of radiation
          emission by any atom must also depend on this interaction, for
          example, on the atom's altitude above sea level. Hence, even according
          to classical mechanics, the times of atomic clocks located at
          different altitudes with respect to the planet must differ from one
          another, and the theory of relativity has absolutely no relation to
          this fact. Whence it follows that the standard definition of a second
          is not correct. It is necessary to indicate in this definition at
          which point on the planet the reference measurement of one second was
          made, e.g., at what height. Let two atoms of the same isotope be
          located on the same straight line passing through the Earth’s center,
          but at different distances from it. The difference between the
          energies of those two atoms, when the latter are in the same
          stationary state, is determined by the formula from classical
          mechanics, ∆E≈g1 g2m∙h, where m is the mass of either atom, h is the
          distance between the centers of the atoms, and gi (i = 1,2) is the
          acceleration of free fall at the point where the ith atom is located.
          It is well-known that in the case of a single constant electric charge
          or a single permanent magnet, we have a purely electric field in a
          certain inertial reference frame (IRF), a purely magnetic field in
          another IRF, and combinations of electric and magnetic fields in other
          IRFs. Another well-known fact consists in that if we consider the
          motion of two charged particles---e.g., two electrons in an
          accelerator or the outer space, ---at identical constant velocities in
          the same direction along parallel lines that are separated by a very
          small distance (approximately equal to three classical electron
          radii), the interaction force between them will be different in
          different IRFs, even the force directions will be different. Let us
          have an explorer at a space station outside the solar system, and let
          a spaceship move at a constant velocity almost equal to c with respect
          to the space station. Let at this velocity 1-2с2 = 1365*24*3600*1012
          ≈3.17×10-20. There is also another researcher in the spaceship.
          Suppose that each of those researchers at the space station and the
          spaceship lives at least 30 years. Let the proper time interval for
          the explorer at the spaceship be equal to 10-8 s. The researcher at
          the station observes the events occurring at the spaceship, and the
          corresponding time interval equals 10,000 years for him. That is, at
          the end of this interval the researcher at the station must be dead,
          whereas the researcher at the spaceship remains alive (this is the
          first conclusion). On the other hand, let the researcher at the
          spaceship observe the events occurring at the space station. In this
          case, if the proper time interval for the researcher at the station is
          equal to 10-8 s, then this time interval is equal to 10,000 years for
          the researcher at the spaceship, i.e., the researcher at the spaceship
          must be dead, whereas the researcher at the station is alive (this is
          the second conclusion), because the IRFs are on an equal footing. The
          first conclusion contradicts the second one, and, since aging and
          death are irreversible processes, both conclusions together contradict
          the laws of thermodynamics. Instead of the researchers, a muon or
          another particle can be located at the space station, and another muon
          or particle at the spaceship. Then, in 10-8 s, the first muon does not
          exist more, and the second one exists in the first reference frame
          (the first conclusion), whereas the first muon exists and the second
          one does not exist in the other reference frame (the second
          conclusion). This is also a contradiction that cannot be logically
          explained. This means that IRFs are not equivalent, i.e., the first
          postulate of the special theory of relativity is not true;
          accordingly, the velocity of electromagnetic waves (EWV) v must depend
          on the selected IRF. Nowadays, the EWV in vacuum in all IRFs is
          assumed to be identical and equal to c = 299792458 m/s. This is also a
          well-known fact. Below, some examples of experiments are proposed that
          will make it possible to find out that the EWV in vacuum in an IRF can
          be higher than c (u > c) if the IRF approaches the wave source, and
          lower than c (u < c) if the IRF moves away from it. Furthermore, the
          velocity of particles---e.g., in an accelerator---can be higher than c
          in the IRFs that move toward the particles (Experiment 11). In order
          to experimentally prove that the EWV in vacuum in an IRF can be higher
          or lower than c, electromagnetic waves should propagate in an
          ultrahigh vacuum, because if a wave propagates in a substance, its
          velocity u and length λ after it leaves the substance may become
          different from those that the wave had before entering the substance.
          In experiments, electromagnetic waves should not be reflected from any
          substance because the indicated parameters can change in this case.
          For the same reason, the electromagnetic wave, before it reaches a
          detector, must not interact with any molecule. In experiments, the
          photons that move from the source of waves (point A) should not
          interact with the reflected photons until the detectors determine the
          corresponding frequency, wavelength, or time of signal arrival to the
          detector. Since the photons interact with one another (entangled
          photons, stimulated radiation), the wave frequency, length, and
          velocity can change at the interaction. It means that the measurement
          has to be carried out at the first moment of signal arrival at the
          detector to avoid the interaction between photons. For the same
          purpose, it is also desirable to use a source of single photons. From
          the above, it follows that the velocity of electromagnetic waves can
          be accurately measured only in one direction, i.e., the one-way
          velocity, whereas the two-way (forward-backward) velocity of
          electromagnetic waves cannot be measured accurately. The temperatures
          of the detector and the entire installation on which the detector and
          the screens moving either toward the wave source or away from it are
          mounted should be close to 0 K (lower than 20 mK or -273.13°C). The
          detector, installation, and screens must not create any electric or
          magnetic field, and must not emit any electromagnetic wave. In all
          wave-velocity experiments, the screens and detectors should be
          arranged at approximately identical altitudes above sea level in order
          to minimize gravitational effects on the determined velocity value.

      <p class="">
        Let the described installation be in an ultrahigh vacuum. A source of
        monochromatic electromagnetic waves (preferably a source of single
        photons), is located at point A, and the waves propagate toward point B
        (see Fig. 1). On a line parallel to line AB there is a rigid rod CD that
        moves toward point A parallel to line AB, and at a constant velocity υ .
        There is a detector on the rod. In Experiment 1, in plane α passing
        through point C and oriented perpendicular to the straight line CD,
        there is an opaque screen with a narrow slit (or several parallel slits,
        or a diffraction grating, or another diffraction element). The width of
        the slit(s) should provide the possibility to observe the diffraction of
        the propagating waves. Another detector---e.g., a second screen to
        observe the diffraction pattern---is located in plane β that passes
        through point D and is also oriented perpendicular to line CD. A
        photodetector can be used as the second screen. The opaque screen or the
        diffraction grating has to be made of an insulator with a relative
        magnetic permeability value close to unity. An extremely high vacuum has
        to be In the middle of the slit (or the parallel slits, or the slits in
        the diffraction grating) in the opaque screen so that electromagnetic
        waves do not pass through the substance. Planes α and β must be fixed
        with respect to each other. The distance DC should be sufficient for a
        diffraction pattern could be observed on the second screen. The distance
        AC must be at least 40 times smaller than the average free path length
        of molecules in the gas in this installation. The temperatures of the
        detector, the opaque screen, and the whole installation have to be close
        to 0 K (lower than 20 mK or -273.13°C). The waves emitted at point A and
        hitting the detector should not pass through a substance and interact
        with molecules. As a result of this experiment, the wavelength is
        determined according to the diffraction pattern obtained on the second
        screen. On rod CD, there can be another detector, which is used to
        determine the wavelength. If required, a point source of monochromatic
        electromagnetic waves can be arranged at point A.

        <h2>Experiment 2</h2>
        <img src="./images/img2.png" alt="Experiment 2" />
        <figcaption>Fig. 2</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="">
        Now let the same source of monochromatic electromagnetic waves
        (preferably a source of single photons), propagating toward point B be
        located at point A. A rigid rod CD moves parallel to line AB at the same
        velocity υ as in Experiment 1 (see Fig. 2). In plane α that passes
        through point C and is perpendicular to the straight line CD, there is
        the active detector surface. The temperatures of the detector and the
        whole installation where the detector is located have to be close to 0 K
        (lower than 20 mK or -273.13°C). In Experiment 2, as a detector, we
        should use a device that allows the wave frequency to be determined; for
        example, it can be a photocell, or a device that uses the Mössbauer
        effect, or some other device. As a result Experiment 2, we determine the
        wave frequency ν. From Experiments 1 and 2, we can find the wave
        velocity v using the well-known formula u = λν (1) . As a result of
        Experiments 1 and 2, we will obtain a velocity value higher than c (u >
        c). Namely, the wave velocity will be determined by the classical
        mechanics formula u = с + .

        <h2>Experiments 3 and 4</h2>

      <p class="">
        Experiments 3 and 4 are analogous to Experiments 1 and 2, respectively,
        but now rod CD moves from point A at a constant velocity u along the
        straight line BA (see Figs. 3 and 4). The wave length λ and frequency ν
        are found in the same way as above. Formula (1) is applied again to
        determine the wave velocity v. It will be lower than c. Namely, the wave
        velocity will be determined by the classical mechanics formula u = с ꟷ .
        We can also carry out an experiment analogous to Experiments 1 and 2,
        but rod CD must be parallel and fixed with respect to line AB. In this
        experiment, the EWV will be equal to c. This experiment is one of those
        aimed at determining the one-way velocity of electromagnetic waves.
        Experiments 5 and 6 In Experiments 1 and 2, if a plate made of a
        substance transparent for the propagating waves is arranged on rod CD in
        front of plane α so that the waves propagating from point A have to pass
        through this plate before hitting the opaque screen and the detector,
        then the wave frequency will be approximately the same as in Experiment
        2, whereas the wavelength will be shorter than that in Experiment 1;
        accordingly, the wave velocity will be equal to c. This fact confirms
        once more that the wave velocity in Experiments 1 and 2 exceeds c (but
        this can be not observed for all electromagnetic waves). For such waves,
        the plate made of a material that is transparent for them must be fixed
        with respect to plane α.

      <p class="">
        Again, let the installation be in an ultrahigh vacuum. A source of
        electromagnetic waves---e.g., a femto- or attosecond laser, or another
        analogous source (preferably a source of single photons), ---is at point
        A, and the waves propagate toward point B. A rigid rod CD is on a line
        parallel to line AB and moves parallel to it toward point A with a
        velocity υ (see Fig. 5). The active surface of the first detector is
        located in the plane that passes through point C perpendicularly to line
        CD, and the active surface of the second detector is located in the
        plane that passes through point D also perpendicularly to line CD. An
        extremely short wave pulse is emitted from point A, and it is registered
        by the active surfaces of the detectors in planes α and β. The detectors
        register the arrival times of the same wave pulse to planes α and β. The
        active surfaces of the detectors, which are fixed with respect to each
        other, are located in planes α and β. The active surface of the detector
        in plane α should have such a shape that the waves emitted from point A
        hit the active surfaces of the detectors located in planes α and β. The
        temperatures of the detectors and the whole installation have to be
        close to 0 K (lower than 20 mK or -273.13°C). The distance CD should be
        at least 40 times smaller than the average free path length of molecules
        in the gas in this installation. Within the interval where the moving
        rod is located, the waves should not pass through a substance and
        interact with molecules until they hit the active surface of the
        detector in plane β. In this experiment, the wave velocity will exceed
        c. Namely, it will be determined by the classical mechanics formula u =
        с + υ.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <h2>Experiment 8</h2>
        <img src="./images/img6.png" alt="Experiment 8" />
        <figcaption>Fig. 6</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="">
        If the rigid rod CD in Experiment 7 moves in parallel to line AB and at
        a constant velocity but away from point A (see Fig. 6), then the wave
        velocity in this experiment will be lower than c. Namely, it will be
        determined by the classical mechanics formula u = с ꟷ . Experiment 9 In
        order to determine the EWV in Experiments 7 and 8, it is not necessary
        to synchronize two clocks that register the times of signal arrival to
        planes α (the first clock) and β (the second clock). Instead, it is
        necessary to take into account the difference ∆t₁-∆t₂, where ∆t₁ = CD/c.
        If the rigid rod CD in Experiments 7 and 8 is stationary and parallel to
        the straight line AB, then ∆t₂ can be determined from this experiment.
        An extremely short wave pulse should be emitted from point A and
        registered by the active surfaces of the detectors in planes α and β.
        The quantity ∆t₂ is the difference between the arrival times of the same
        wave pulse to planes β (registered by the second clock) and α
        (registered by the first clock). If the first and second clocks are
        synchronized, then ∆t₁ = ∆t₂. Experiment. 10 In Experiments 7 and 8, if
        a plate of a substance transparent for the waves is mounted on rod CD in
        front of plane α in order to make the waves propagating from point A
        pass through this plate, then the wave velocity will be equal to c. This
        fact confirms once more that the EWVs in Experiments 7 and 8 were not
        equal to c (but this can be not observed for all electromagnetic waves).
        For such waves, the plate made of a material that is transparent for
        them must be fixed with respect to plane α. In Experiments 1 to 10,
        research can be carried out in various frequency intervals. However, in
        Experiments 1 to 6 inclusive, the electromagnetic waves must be
        monochromatic. In experiments 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, the wave frequency,
        length, and propagation velocity will be determined by classical
        mechanics formulas. However, if the waves propagating from the source
        (point A) interact with the waves reflected from rod CD or the detectors
        mounted on rod CD, then the wave frequency, length, and velocity will
        not be determined by those formulas. Another source of waves can be
        mounted on rod CD to study how waves with different frequencies interact
        and how the interaction of waves depends on the angle between the
        propagation directions of those waves.

        The velocity of charged particles in an accelerator with respect to the
        latter does not exceed c, but it can exceed it relatively to another
        IRF. Let charged particles move in an ultrahigh vacuum---e.g., in an
        accelerator---at the velocity 1 with respect to the accelerator in a
        certain region along a straight trajectory AB. Let the velocity
        magnitude 1 be almost equal to c. If a detector or a system of detectors
        that determine the velocity of particles in the accelerator moves along
        the straight trajectory BA (so that the charged particles move toward
        the detector, see Fig. 7), then the magnitude of the particle velocity
        relatively to the detector will be equal to υ1+ υ2 , where 2 is the
        velocity of the detector or the system of detectors with respect to the
        accelerator. As the detector, a photographic plate in which the
        Vavilov-Cherenkov effect is used, or another detector, or a system of
        detectors can be applied. The temperatures of the detector and the whole
        installation should be close to 0 K (lower than 20 mK or -273.13°C). The
        detector (the system of detectors), as well as the whole installation
        that moves towards charged particles, must not create an electric or
        magnetic field and emit or reflect any electromagnetic waves until the
        detector measures the velocity. As a result of this experiment, the
        velocity-addition formula of the special theory of relativity will not
        hold. No Lorentz contraction is observed in the described experiments.

        <p class="">
          As a result of the described experiments and considerations, the
          special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity
          turns out not valid, and the postulates of the special theory of
          relativity are also incorrect. All eleven experiments can be performed
          at other temperatures different from the indicated one. It may be
          possible to prove that the special theory of relativity and the
          general theory of relativity are not true under other experimental
          conditions as well, e.g., at other temperatures.
